# Zeplin_Raid
Python game using John Zelle's graphics library

Current state of the project is just source code in python 3.8.

### Goals:

- Package code so it is more distributable
- Add a splash screen
- Implement difficulty levels and some amount of progression

This all started as a fun side project in high School, thanks for checking it out.
